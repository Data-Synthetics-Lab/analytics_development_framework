# analytics_development_framework
This repository is to implement a modern analytics development framework using SQL as the templating language, with CI/CD using GitHub repositories and GitHub Action

## UML Concepts in SQL
* Classes: Represented by tables (e.g., Customer, Order).
* Attributes: Represented by columns in tables.
* Methods: Represented by stored procedures and functions (e.g., UpdateCustomerStatus, GetOrdersCrossSell).
* Relationships: Represented by foreign keys and joins (e.g., customerId in Order table).

## Summary
* Define tables to represent entities.
* Establish relationships using foreign keys.
* Create views for complex queries and derived data.
* Encapsulate behaviors using stored procedures and functions.
  
This approach leverages SQL's capabilities to create a robust data model framework, incorporating UML concepts for a clear and structured design.
